#Project 6: Go Ubiquitous

In this project, you will build a wearable watch face for Sunshine to run 
on an Android Wear device.

##Why this Project

Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate your app more directly into users’ lives. 
As a new developer, it will be important for you to understand how to perform 
this integration. This project gives you an opportunity to design a companion app 
for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.

##What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Android Wear.
* Design for multiple watch form factors.
* Communicate between a mobile device and a wearable device.

##How Do I Complete this Project?

###Supporting Courses

You should have the skills you need to complete this app after completing:

* Developing Android Apps
http://www.udacity.com/course/ud853-nd
* Advanced Android App Development
http://www.udacity.com/course/ud855-nd
* Android Ubiquitous Computing
http://www.udacity.com/course/ud875-nd


###Required Tasks

* Clone/Download a zip file of the final branch of Sunshine from Advanced Android App Development.
https://github.com/udacity/Advanced_Android_Development/tree/7.05_Pretty_Wallpaper_Time
* Spend time exploring the samples built into Android Studio, looking for ways to 
incorporate that functionality into an Android Wear watchface.


###Design Mocks

Feel free to use the following square and round designs as a design reference.
